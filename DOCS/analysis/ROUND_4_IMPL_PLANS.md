# Round 4 — Implementation Plans (Deep code review → plan + feasibility)

Generated: 2025-09-12 14:34:15+02:00
Coordinator: Cascade
Scope: Each AI performs a fourth rotation and, for each document in scope, proposes concrete implementation plans mapped to code locations. Include feasibility, complexity, test impact, and risks. Record outputs in your own AI_ANALYSIS_#.md under “Round 4 Implementation Plans”.

## Rotation Mapping (Left by 4 total → returns to original owner’s left neighbor)

- AI 1 prepares plans for AI 1’s own Round 1 doc set (closing the loop from prior rotations).
- AI 2 prepares plans for AI 2’s own Round 1 doc set.
- AI 3 prepares plans for AI 3’s own Round 1 doc set.
- AI 4 prepares plans for AI 4’s own Round 1 doc set.

Rationale: After two peer reviews and severity triage, ownership returns to the original authors for implementation planning.

## Plan Template (per finding/area)

- Summary: one-line description of the change
- Code targets: file(s), function(s), module(s)
- Steps:
  1. Changes (bullets with ordered ops)
  2. Tests (what to add/update)
  3. Telemetry/docs (facts, rustdoc, SPEC updates)
- Feasibility: High/Medium/Low
- Complexity: 1–5 (estimate)
- Risks: short list + mitigations
- Dependencies: other PRs or sequencing

## Tasks (for all AIs)

- For each high/medium priority item from Round 3, author a plan using the template.
- Cite exact code locations (e.g., `cargo/switchyard/src/fs/backup.rs::create_snapshot()`), and reference SPEC/PLAN where applicable.
- Ensure testability: list unit/integration tests. Use env toggles like `SWITCHYARD_FORCE_EXDEV` where relevant.

## Deliverables

- Updated AI_ANALYSIS_#.md with a “Round 4 Implementation Plans” section containing plans per prioritized item.
- Do not land code changes in this round; this is planning only.

## Definition of Done

- Every high/medium priority item has a concrete, code-referenced plan with feasibility and complexity ratings.
