## Summary
- Core operations are tested with in-module unit tests: swap round-trip, restore idempotence, mount checks, redaction.
- Gaps remain for EXDEV degraded path, sidecar corruption handling, immutable bit detection, and schema validation of facts.

## Inventory / Findings
- Existing tests (examples)
  - `fs/swap.rs`:
    - `atomic_swap_creates_symlink_pointing_to_source`
    - `replace_and_restore_roundtrip`
  - `fs/restore.rs`:
    - `symlink_topology_restore_roundtrip`
    - `none_topology_restore_removes_target`
    - `idempotent_restore_file_twice_is_noop`
  - `fs/backup.rs`:
    - `snapshot_file_creates_payload_and_sidecar`
    - `snapshot_symlink_creates_symlink_backup_and_sidecar`
    - `snapshot_none_creates_tombstone_and_sidecar`
  - `fs/mount.rs`:
    - `ensure_rw_exec_*` trio
  - `logging/redact.rs`:
    - `redact_masks_and_removes_expected_fields`
  - `api.rs` (facade):
    - `emits_minimal_facts_for_plan_preflight_apply`
    - `rollback_reverts_first_action_on_second_failure`

- Gaps
  - EXDEV degraded path: Use `SWITCHYARD_FORCE_EXDEV=1` to simulate and assert `degraded=true` with `degraded_reason="exdev_fallback"` when allowed; assert failure with `error_id=E_EXDEV` when disallowed.
  - Immutable bit: Preflight `check_immutable` path depends on `lsattr`; add test that stubs command or marks xfail in environments without `lsattr`.
  - Sidecar corruption: Malformed/missing sidecar paths already covered partially; add tests for malformed JSON and mismatch handling.
  - Facts schema validation: Validate emitted facts against `SPEC/audit_event.schema.json`.
  - Rescue tooling: Add tests around `SWITCHYARD_FORCE_RESCUE_OK` to ensure gating behavior.
  - Ownership gating: Add tests verifying `strict_ownership` behavior with a mock `OwnershipOracle` returning errors.
  - Retention: Tests for future `prune_backups` hook (see RETENTION_STRATEGY.md).

## Recommendations (Backlog)
1. Add EXDEV degraded-mode tests (allowed vs disallowed).
2. Add JSON Schema validation for facts across all stages.
3. Add sidecar corruption tests for file and symlink prior_kind.
4. Add rescue profile gating tests using env overrides.
5. Add ownership gating tests with a mock oracle.
6. Add retention pruning tests once implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New tests added; CI runs them deterministically (use tmpfs where possible and feature-gated env overrides).
- Facts schema validation passes for all emitted events in unit tests.

## Round 2 Gap Analysis (AI 2, 2025-09-12 15:23 CEST)

- **Invariant:** Comprehensive test coverage validates consumer expectations
- **Assumption (from doc):** Existing tests cover the critical paths consumers depend on for reliable operation
- **Reality (evidence):** Unit tests exist for core operations at `src/fs/swap.rs:L149-L200`, `src/fs/restore.rs:L234-L277`, and others; however, gaps exist for EXDEV degraded paths, sidecar corruption, and schema validation
- **Gap:** Missing test coverage for edge cases consumers may encounter in production; no integration tests validate end-to-end consumer workflows
- **Mitigations:** Implement gap tests listed in document; add integration tests that simulate typical consumer usage patterns
- **Impacted users:** Consumer applications that may encounter untested edge cases in production
- **Follow-ups:** Prioritize EXDEV and sidecar corruption tests; add consumer workflow integration tests

- **Invariant:** Facts schema compliance ensures audit trail reliability
- **Assumption (from doc):** Emitted facts conform to documented schema for consumer parsing and compliance
- **Reality (evidence):** Document identifies need for facts schema validation against `SPEC/audit_event.schema.json`; no current tests validate fact conformance
- **Gap:** Schema violations could break consumer audit processing and compliance workflows
- **Mitigations:** Implement JSON Schema validation tests for all fact types; add CI validation of schema compliance
- **Impacted users:** Compliance systems and audit processors that parse Switchyard facts
- **Follow-ups:** Add schema validation to test suite; implement CI gate for fact schema compliance

- **Invariant:** Environment variable behavior consistency across test scenarios
- **Assumption (from doc):** Test environment variables like `SWITCHYARD_FORCE_EXDEV` provide reliable test interfaces
- **Reality (evidence):** Document mentions using `SWITCHYARD_FORCE_EXDEV=1` for degraded path testing; environment variable testing framework exists but coverage incomplete
- **Gap:** Incomplete environment variable testing may hide behavioral inconsistencies that affect consumer testing frameworks
- **Mitigations:** Add comprehensive environment variable tests; document expected behavior for all test knobs
- **Impacted users:** Testing frameworks and CI systems that rely on environment variable controls
- **Follow-ups:** Complete environment variable test coverage; document test knob behavior guarantees
