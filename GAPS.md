ðŸš© High-risk gaps before production

Rollback

REQ-R2 (restore exact topology) and REQ-R3 (idempotent rollback) â€” without these, rollback may leave subtle corruption or fail in chained apply/rollback cycles.

Locking

REQ-L4 (LockManager required in production) â€” currently optional; production needs hard enforcement + doc.

Rescue

REQ-RC1 (rescue profile) â€” fallback must be verifiably available; otherwise failure modes are brittle.

Health verification

REQ-H3 (health verification in commit) â€” commit isnâ€™t really safe until smoke/health passes.

Filesystem coverage

REQ-F3 (supported FS verified) â€” otherwise you canâ€™t claim portability guarantees.

CI

REQ-CI2/3 â€” zero-SKIP + golden diff gate are needed to enforce determinism in practice.
